# CS-Project-7

 You have arrived in the walled city of Flatula, whose residents eat beans, cabbage, and hard-boiled eggs with every meal. Although they are used to the resulting effects, the odor that emanates from the Flatulans you encounter makes you woozy. Your only hope to keep from passing out is to successfully preach to the Flatulans about converting to a diet of lean meat, lettuce, and rice.

That's the scenario for a new video game under development. Your assignment is to complete the prototype that uses character-based graphics.
